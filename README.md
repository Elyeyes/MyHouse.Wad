This project is an Android App for Home Automation using Kotlin and Android Studio.

The app connects to a virtual house given by the professor and the interaction is possible using APIs

Here is a list of the application's features:

-Create a user
-Authentify as a user

-Connect to your house as an owner
-Display all the houses you have access to
-Connect to someone's house as a guest (if the owner allows it)


-Display all the house's devices
-Control all the devices of the house

-Add and delete users to the control of your house

-Change language between English or French
-Change NightMode or LightMode

-Setup a Mode to control the devices the way you like in one go
-Close everything for when you leave the house (virtual remember)

We can imagine the possibility to haeve multiple modes and to have them set by time
The code is flexible in that way
